# How to run the codes

To work with the codes, copy the codes from GitHub and paste them into Google Colab (you can also download it from GitHub and upload it to Google Colab). To run the codes in Google Colab, first navigate to the 'Runtime' tab, then click on 'change runtime type' and change the 'Hardware accelerator' to GPU. After that, go to the 'Runtime' tab and select 'run all'. Repeat the aforementioned steps to execute all four codes one at a time and observe the outcomes.
